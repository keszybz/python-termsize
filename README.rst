Querying the size of the output terminal
========================================

.. _get_terminal_size:

function ``get_terminal_size(fallback=(columns, rows))``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the size of the terminal window.

For each of the two dimensions, the environment variable, ``COLUMNS``
and ``ROWS`` respectively, is checked. If the variable is defined and
the value is a positive integer, it is used.

When ``COLUMNS`` or ``ROWS`` is not defined, which is the common case,
the terminal connected to ``sys.__stdout__`` is queried.

If the terminal size cannot be successfully queried, either because
the system doesn't support querying, or because we are not
connected to a terminal, the value given in ``fallback`` parameter
is used.

The value returned is a named tuple of type ``terminal_size``.

function ``get_terminal_size_raw(fd=STDOUT_FILENO)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Return the size of the terminal window as ``(columns, rows)``,
tuple of type `terminal_size`_.

The optional argument ``fd`` (default ``STDOUT_FILENO``, or standard
output) specifies which file descriptor should be queried.

If the file descriptor is not connected to a terminal, a ``OSError``,
is thrown.

`get_terminal_size`_ is the high-level function which should normally
be used, ``get_terminal_size_raw`` is the low-level implementation.

.. _terminal size:

named tuple terminal_size(tuple)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A tuple of ``(columns, rows)`` for holding terminal window size.

- attribute: ``columns``

   Width of the terminal window in characters.

- attribute: ``rows``

   Height of the terminal window in characters.
